Hayley, I had some trouble with Heroku... My functions are not working like they do when run on local server. I'm on a Flight Sunday morning to Broome for work so I've done my best to get everything done... Except you'll see the CSS game is weak. 

In my local server I had acheived all the tasks in part 1 and 2 of the project requirements. For the additional features, I added an edit and delete option on the stories. 
(You can also edit your profile, it just takes you back to the Create Profile form with your data pre-filled should you want to keep some of it. Please refer to my Create Profile Screenshot which is actually an edit profile page...)

Things I am proud of: 
1. I did it! (Well in the local server and with poor CSS)
2. You can edit your profile and I'm so proud of being able to include your own image address url to both profile and story 
3. I ventured into the categories section (from additional features for the project) using a generic listView function for the "view story by author" section, as there were plans to have a whole page dedicated to just the authors and then another button to view a specific author's story. A bit of a rabbit hole and through conversation this was more in relation to the categories section, which I did not get around to doing, but I would have a bit of an idea of how to do it now. In the end, you CAN view stories by Author by clicking on their name. 
4. Super proud of the new widget for dateime.timezone (Thanks Ben!)

Things that wont work in Heroku:
1. edit profile - so this means no new users or cool photos, and better, content.
2. create new profile
#sadness... 

Please check out my screenshots as proof that everything was running smoothly on local server. 

Heroku, not so much... 

I will endeavor to look further into this, to see how these errors, which I'm sure you'll encouter, can be fixed in heroku app. 

See you in a couple of weeks!

Thanks, Hayley!
